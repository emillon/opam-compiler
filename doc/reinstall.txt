NAME
       opam-compiler-reinstall - Reinstall the compiler

SYNOPSIS
       opam-compiler reinstall [OPTION]... 

       Reinstall the compiler will propagate the changes done to its source.

       There are two ways to reinstall:

       Full (default)
           Reinstall the compiler and all the packages in the switch. This
           can be slow but is always safe.

       Quick (unsafe)
           Only reinstall the compiler. This is fast, but will break the
           switch if the way it compiles is modified for example.
OPTIONS
       --configure-command=COMMAND
           Use this instead of "./configure".

       --full
           Perform a full reinstallation (default).

       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of `auto',
           `pager', `groff' or `plain'. With `auto', the format is `pager` or
           `plain' whenever the TERM env var is `dumb' or undefined.

       --quick
           Perform a quick reinstallation (unsafe)
