Creating and updating a switch
==============================

References can move; in that case the switch can be updated:

  $ $EXE update 'user:branch'
  Updating switch: "user:branch"
  Resolving to Github_commit { user = "user"; repo = "ocaml"; hash = ? }
  Updating opam switch named "user:branch" based in Github_commit { user = "user"; repo = "ocaml"; hash = ? }
